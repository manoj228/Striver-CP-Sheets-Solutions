Problem Statement: 
A string is called a k-string if it can be represented as k concatenated copies of some string. 
For example, the string "aabaabaabaab" is at the same time a 1-string, a 2-string and a 4-string, but it is not a 3-string, a 5-string, or a 6-string and so on. Obviously any string is a 1-string.

You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters and a positive integer k. 
Your task is to reorder the letters in the string s in such a way that the resulting string is a k-string.

Input1:
2
aazz

output1:
azaz

Input2:
3
abcabcabz

output:
-1

C++ Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int k;
	cin >> k;
	
	string str;
	cin >> str;
	
	sort(str.begin(), str.end());
	
	string first, second;
	int size = str.size();
	
	for(int i = 0; i < size; i += k) first += str[i];

	for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) second += first;
		
	first = second;
	sort(second.begin(), second.end());	
	
	if(second != str)
		cout << "-1";
	else
		cout << first;
	
}

int main() {
	
	int t = 1;
//	cin >> t;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
