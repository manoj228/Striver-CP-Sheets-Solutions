Problem Statement :
Leo has developed a new programming language C+=. 
In C+=, integer variables can only be changed with a "+=" operation that adds the right-hand side value to the left-hand side variable. 
For example, performing "a += b" when a = 2, b = 3 changes the value of a to 5 (the value of b does not change).

In a prototype program Leo has two integer variables a and b, initialized with some positive values. He can perform any number of operations "a += b" or "b += a". 
Leo wants to test handling large integers, so he wants to make the value of either a or b strictly greater than a given value n. 
What is the smallest number of operations he has to perform?

Example:
Input:
2
1 2 3
5 4 100

Output:
2
7


C++ Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int a,b,n;
	cin >> a >> b >> n;
	
	int c = 0;
	
	while(a <= n)
	{
		if(a > b) swap(a, b);
		
		a += b;
		c++;
	}
	
	cout << c;

}

int main() {
	
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
