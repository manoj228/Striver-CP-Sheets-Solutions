Problem Statement: 
There are two rival donut shops.

The first shop sells donuts at retail: each donut costs a dollars.

The second shop sells donuts only in bulk: box of b donuts costs c dollars. 
So if you want to buy x donuts from this shop, then you have to buy the smallest number of boxes such that the total number of donuts in them is greater or equal to x.

You want to determine two positive integer values:

how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the first shop than in the second shop?
how many donuts can you buy so that they are strictly cheaper in the second shop than in the first shop?
If any of these values doesn't exist then that value should be equal to −1. If there are multiple possible answers, then print any of them

Input:
4
5 10 4
4 5 20
2 2 3
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

output:
-1 20
8 -1
1 2
-1 1000000000

C++ Solution:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int a, b, c;
	cin >> a >> b >> c;
	
	if(a >= c) cout << "-1 ";
	else cout << "1 ";
	
	if(c/b < a) cout << b;
	else cout << "-1";
	
}

int main(){
	
	int testCases ;
	cin >> testCases;
	
	while(testCases--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
