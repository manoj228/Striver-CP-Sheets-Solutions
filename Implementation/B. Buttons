Problem Statement: 
Manao is trying to open a rather challenging lock.
The lock has n buttons on it and to open it, you should press the buttons in a certain order to open the lock. 
When you push some button, it either stays pressed into the lock (that means that you've guessed correctly and pushed the button that goes next in the sequence), or all pressed buttons return to the initial position. When all buttons are pressed into the lock at once, the lock opens.

Consider an example with three buttons. Let's say that the opening sequence is: {2, 3, 1}. If you first press buttons 1 or 3, the buttons unpress immediately. 
If you first press button 2, it stays pressed. If you press 1 after 2, all buttons unpress. If you press 3 after 2, buttons 3 and 2 stay pressed. As soon as you've got two pressed buttons, you only need to press button 1 to open the lock.

Manao doesn't know the opening sequence. But he is really smart and he is going to act in the optimal way. 
Calculate the number of times he's got to push a button in order to open the lock in the worst-case scenario.

C++ Solution:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


void solve()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	long long int  res = n, i = 0;
	
	while(--n && ++i)
	  	res += n*i;
	
	cout << res ;
}

int main(){
	
	int testCases = 1;
	//cin >> testCases;
	
	while(testCases--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
