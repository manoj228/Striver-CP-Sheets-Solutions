Problem Statement :
Vanya got n cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. 
Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows:
the top level of the pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist of 1 + 2 = 3 cubes, the third level must have 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 cubes, and so on. 
Thus, the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1 + 2 + ... + (i - 1) + i cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.

Example:
Input:
25 

Output:
4

C++ Solution 1:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	int i = 0;

  while(i*(i+1)*(i+2)/6 <= n) i++;
	
	cout << i-1 ;
}

int main() {
	
	int t=1;
//	cin >> t;
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}

C++ Solution 2:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	/*
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 1 + 2 = 3
	3 -> 3 + 3 = 6
	4 -> 6 + 4 = 10
	*/
	
	int i, sum = 0, prev = 0, total = 0;
	for(i = 1; total <= n; i++)
	{
		prev = sum;
		sum = i + prev;
		
		total += sum;
	}
	
	cout << i-2 ;
}

int main() {
	
	int t=1;
//	cin >> t;
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
