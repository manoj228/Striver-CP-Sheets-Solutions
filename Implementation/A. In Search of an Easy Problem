Problem Statement :

When preparing a tournament, Codeforces coordinators try treir best to make the first problem as easy as possible. 
This time the coordinator had chosen some problem and asked n people about their opinions. Each person answered whether this problem is easy or hard.

If at least one of these n people has answered that the problem is hard, the coordinator decides to change the problem.
For the given responses, check if the problem is easy enough.


Example1:
Input:
3
0 0 1

Output:
HARD

Example2:
Input:
1
0

Output:
EASY

C++ Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
void solve()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	int x;
	string res = "EASY";
	for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
	{
		cin >> x;
		
		if(x == 1) res = "HARD";
	}
	
	cout << res ;
}
 
int main() {
	
	int t = 1;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
	}
	
	return 0;
}
