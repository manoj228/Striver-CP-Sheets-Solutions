Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons:

Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces.
Cube. Cube has 6 square faces.
Octahedron. Octahedron has 8 triangular faces.
Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.
Icosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.

Input
4
Icosahedron
Cube
Tetrahedron
Dodecahedron

output
42

c++ solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int side(char c)
{
	switch(c)
	{
		case 'T' : return 4;
		case 'C' : return 6;
		case 'I' : return 20;
		case 'O' : return 8;
		case 'D' : return 12;
		
	}
	
	return 0;
}
 
int sum = 0;
 
void solve()
{
	string str;
	cin >> str;
	
	sum += side(str[0]);
}
 
int main() {
	
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
	}
	cout << sum;
	
	return 0;
}
