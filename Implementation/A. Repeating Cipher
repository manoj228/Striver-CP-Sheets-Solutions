Problem Statement: 
Polycarp loves ciphers. He has invented his own cipher called repeating.

Repeating cipher is used for strings. To encrypt the string s=s1s2…sm (1≤m≤10), Polycarp uses the following algorithm:

he writes down s1 ones,
he writes down s2 twice,
he writes down s3 three times,
...
he writes down sm m times.
For example, if s="bab" the process is: "b" → "baa" → "baabbb". So the encrypted s="bab" is "baabbb".

Given string t — the result of encryption of some string s. Your task is to decrypt it, i. e. find the string s.


Input:
10
ooopppssss

output:
oops

C++ Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	string str, res = "";
	cin >> str;
	
	int s = 0;
	for(int i = 0; s + i < n; i++)
	{
		s += i;
		res += str[s];
	}
	
	cout << res;
	
	return 0;
}#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	string str, res = "";
	cin >> str;
	
	int s = 0;
	for(int i = 0; s + i < n; i++)
	{
		s += i;
		res += str[s];
	}
	
	cout << res;
	
	return 0;
}
