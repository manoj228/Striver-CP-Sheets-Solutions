Problem Statement: 
Numbers 1,2,3,…n (each integer from 1 to n once) are written on a board. 
In one operation you can erase any two numbers a and b from the board and write one integer a+b2 rounded up instead.

You should perform the given operation n−1 times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.

For example, if n=4, the following course of action is optimal:

choose a=4 and b=2, so the new number is 3, and the whiteboard contains [1,3,3];
choose a=3 and b=3, so the new number is 3, and the whiteboard contains [1,3];
choose a=1 and b=3, so the new number is 2, and the whiteboard contains [2].
It's easy to see that after n−1 operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.

Input:
1
4

output:
2
2 4
3 3
3 1


C++ Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int n;
	cin >> n;
	
	cout << "2" << endl;
	cout << n << " " << n-1 << endl;
	
	for(int i = n; i > 2; i--)
	{
		cout << i-2 << " " << i << endl;
	}
} 

int main() {
	
	int t ;
	cin >> t;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
 
  return 0;
}
