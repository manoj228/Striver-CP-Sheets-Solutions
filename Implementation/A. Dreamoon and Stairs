Problem Statement: 
Dreamoon wants to climb up a stair of n steps. He can climb 1 or 2 steps at each move. Dreamoon wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer m.

What is the minimal number of moves making him climb to the top of the stairs that satisfies his condition?

Inputs    -> outputs:
10   2    -> 6
3    5    -> -1
1000 2    -> 5000


C++ Solution:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	int n, m;
	cin >> n >> m;
	
	if(n < m)
		cout << "-1";
	else
	{
		// to make multiple of 2 
		// why ? + 1 => adding 1 for odd number to make it even
		int k = (n + 1) / 2;
		
		// to make multiple of m , / and * by m
		cout << (k + m - 1) / m * m;		
	}
	
}

int main(){
	
	int testCases = 1;
	//cin >> testCases;
	
	while(testCases--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
