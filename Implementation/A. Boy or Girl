Problem Statement :
Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. 
Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). 
After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. 
So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. 
You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.


Example1:
Input:
wjmzbmr

Output:
CHAT WITH HER!

Example2:
Input:
xiaodao

Output:
IGNORE HIM!


C++ Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve()
{
	set<char> st;
	
	string str;
	cin >> str;
	
	for(auto &ch : str)
	st.insert(ch);
	
	int size = st.size();
	
	if(size & 1) cout << "IGNORE HIM!";
	else cout << "CHAT WITH HER!";
}

int main() {
	
	int t = 1;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		solve();
		cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
