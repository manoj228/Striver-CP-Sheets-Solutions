The classic programming language of Bitland is Bit++. This language is so peculiar and complicated.

The language is that peculiar as it has exactly one variable, called x. Also, there are two operations:

Operation ++ increases the value of variable x by 1.
Operation -- decreases the value of variable x by 1.
A statement in language Bit++ is a sequence, consisting of exactly one operation and one variable x. 
The statement is written without spaces, that is, it can only contain characters "+", "-", "X". Executing a statement means applying the operation it contains.

A programme in Bit++ is a sequence of statements, each of them needs to be executed. Executing a programme means executing all the statements it contains.

You're given a programme in language Bit++. 
The initial value of x is 0. Execute the programme and find its final value (the value of the variable when this programme is executed).

Input1 :
1
++X
Output1 : 1

Input2 :
2
X++
--X
Output2 : 0

C++ solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
	
	int t, x = 0;
	cin >> t;
	
	while(t--)
	{
		string str;
		cin >> str;
		
		int len = str.size();
		
		if(str[0] == '+' || str[len-1] == '+')
		{
			x++;
		}
		else{
			x--;
		}
	}
	
	cout << x << endl;
	
	return 0;
}
