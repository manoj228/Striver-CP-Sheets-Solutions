A positive (strictly greater than zero) integer is called round if it is of the form d00...0.
In other words, a positive integer is round if all its digits except the leftmost (most significant) are equal to zero. 
In particular, all numbers from 1 to 9 (inclusive) are round.

For example, the following numbers are round: 4000, 1, 9, 800, 90. The following numbers are not round: 110, 707, 222, 1001.

You are given a positive integer n (1≤n≤104). Represent the number n as a sum of round numbers using the minimum number of summands (addends). 
In other words, you need to represent the given number n as a sum of the least number of terms, each of which is a round number.

C++ Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
	
	int t;
	cin >> t;
	
	while(t--)
	{
	string str;
	cin >> str;
	
	int n = str.size();
	int p = 1;
	vector<int> res;
	for(int i = n-1; i>=0; i--)
	{
		int curNum = str[i] - '0';
 
		if(curNum > 0)
		res.push_back(curNum * p);
		
		p *= 10;
		
	}
	
	cout << res.size() << endl;
	for(int &val : res) cout << val << " ";
	cout << endl;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
